# Loto

A program to play the lottery without sinking money into it. 
Actually, it serves more as an educational purpose, because if a rational person understood the odds of winning the lottery, they wouldn't play.

Further improvements could include Computer Graphics, maybe even generating some of the numbers the player chose, in order to give them more dopamine. 

The inspiration for this application came from this infographic:
